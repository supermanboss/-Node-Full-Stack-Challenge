- how to setup and runï¼š 
1. Running command in DOS server: node app.js; 
2. Click index.html in client file 

- documentation on the solution:
The front-end uses html, integrates vue, and calls the back-end express interface to add, delete, modify, and check json files.


- how long did you spend ceating the application:
Two days

- any assumptions made:
The initial assumption was to build the Express + Vue development environment (front-end and back-end separation), 
link mongoDB to implement the function of adding, deleting, modifying, and checking, 
and then use element UI to complete all functions.


- any queries that need resolving:
All queies can display on the app.


- what part of the application you most proud of (if any):
Successful get, add, update and delete symbol; 
Successful stored data in symbols.json.


- any improvements you would make: 
Increase the visualization of the front-end page and improve the efficiency of the code
